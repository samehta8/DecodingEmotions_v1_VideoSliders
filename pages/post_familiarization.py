        You will now begin the survey. Please pay maximum attention as possible throughout the trial, and try to be as accurate as possible in your selection of the emotions and result estimates. 
                
        Remember, you can pick as many emotions are you like for each of the clips you are about to see, but you cannot keep all emotions at 0 - if that is the case, Neutral must be greater than 0.
